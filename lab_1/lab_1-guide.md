## Lab Objectives
We will have achieved the following objectives upon completion of Lab 1:

* Access all devices in the lab
* Deployed the full network topology (XRd frontend, SONiC backend)
* Basic familiarity with containerlab
* Confirm IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity
* Familiarity with base SRv6 configuration 


## Topology 

Our network consists of a frontend/WAN with 7 XRd routers providing SRv6 transport services and a 6-node SONiC fabric to simulate an AI/ML backend network. We have a pair of Ubuntu containers (London and Rome) connected to the XRd network, and three Ubuntu VMs (London) running as a Kubernetes cluster and connected to both XRd frontend and SONiC backend networks.

![Lab Topology](../topo_drawings/overview-topology-large.png)

Lab 1 focuses exclusively on the XRd frontend network.

## Selecting Student Pod and Connecting to VPN
1. You will be using the web based ILT Assistant tool for student pod assignment and connecting your VPN. First, you should have been assigned a lab **POD #** from 1 to 30 by the proctor and been given the six digit **Access Code** for today's lab.
   
2. Open a browser on your desktop and go the ILT Assistant tool at the following URL https://lab-assistant.com/ and
   enter your lab **Access Code** as shown in the below screenshot.

<img src="../topo_drawings/lab-assistant-step-1.png" width="800" />

3. Now on the LTRSPG-2212 screen click the **POD** button to bring up the list of available pods and select the pod number you were assigned.

<img src="../topo_drawings/lab-assistant-step-2.png" width="800" />
<img src="../topo_drawings/lab-assistant-step-3.png" width="800" />


4. Last step. Now that you have an assigned pod click on the **Connect VPN** button as highlighted bellow to launch the Secure Client VPN on your desktop and connect to your dCLoud Pod.

## Accessing the routers 

⚠️⚠️⚠️  Note: This section is provided for reference only. We will walk through router access during the live demo. ⚠️⚠️⚠️ 

Lab attendees can interact with the routers in multiple ways. They may choose to ssh to the **topology host** VM and use it as a jumpbox to the routers.

However, it is **recommended** to use **Visual Studio Code** on the provided **Windows virtual machine** for a more streamlined experience.

This environment comes pre-configured with useful extensions such as:

- **Remote-SSH**
- **Containerlab**

These tools allow attendees to:

- Start and manage topologies  
- SSH into routers  
- Access containers  
- Capture traffic easily using **Edgeshark**

This setup simplifies lab operations and significantly enhances usability.

1. RDP to the Windows Virtual machine from the lab attendee laptop:

   The lab can be accessed using a Remote Desktop connection to the windows management hosts at 198.18.128.102 **(admin / cisco123)**

![windows-rdp](.././topo_drawings/windows-rdp.png)


2. Launch Visual Code:

![launch visual code](../topo_drawings/lab1-visual-code-launch.png)

Visual code will connect to the topology host and lab attendees should enter the **"cisco123"** password 

![connect using visual code](../topo_drawings/lab1-visual-code-connect.png)

You are now connected to the topology host and can start topologies and inspect traffic. At the moment, no topology is started. Make sure you click on the containerlab extension before you can start a topology.

![connected visual code](../topo_drawings/lab1-visual-code-connected.png)


**User Credentials**
All VMs, routers, etc. use the same user credentials:
```
User: cisco, Password: cisco123
```

## Lab Repository Update (Required)

At the start of the lab, you must update the local lab repository to ensure it matches the latest official version hosted on GitHub.  
GitHub is the **source of truth** for all lab files.

Launch a terminal to the topology host and use the commands below to reset your local copy to exactly match the remote repository.

![ssh](../topo_drawings/topology-host-ssh.png)


```bash
cd ~/LTRSPG-2212
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```
This downloads the latest changes from GitHub and updates all tracked files so your local repository exactly matches the current main branch without applying any local modifications.

![git](../topo_drawings/git-fetch.png)



## Launch and Validate XRD Topology

The containerlab visual code extension will be used to launch lab 1:

![connected visual code](../topo_drawings/lab1-launch-topology.png)

The icons should turn green to visually indicate that the topology has been successfully deployed in Containerlab.

![connected visual code](../topo_drawings/lab1-topology-launched.png)

We can also verify the containerlab logs in the visual code output window. Truncated example:

```

```

> [!NOTE]
> All *containerlab* commands can be abbreviated to *clab*. Example: *sudo clab deploy -t lab_1-topology.clab.yaml*

If the terminal is not visible in VScode, please launch a new terminal using the terminal / New terminal tabs. that way, you will be directly connected to the topology host using SSH.


### Connect to the Topology Host and SSH to Containers.

The entire lab is doable from visual code, you should launch a terminal and it will automatically ssh into the topology host.

![terminal visual code](../topo_drawings/lab1-visual-code-terminal.png)

Run a couple commands to verify the docker/router containers are up
```
docker ps -a
sudo containerlab inspect --all
```

![ssh verification](../topo_drawings/lab1-visual-code-ssh-verification.png)



> [!IMPORTANT]
> The XRd router instances should be available for SSH access about 1 - 2 minutes after spin up.


To establish an SSH session to an IOS-XRd router, use the Containerlab Visual Studio Code extension. Right-click on the router and select SSH from the context menu.

![ssh into xrd01](../topo_drawings/lab1-ssh-xrd01.png)


The London and Rome Linux containers will be used to run validation tests throughout the lab. To access these containers, use the same method as for an IOS-XRd router: right-click on the container in the Containerlab VS Code extension, select SSH, and repeat the same procedure.
The same credentials used for the IOS-XRd routers apply.

![Attach terminal](../topo_drawings/lab1-attach-terminal.png)


### Accessing the London K8s Control Plane VM

The three **London VMs** have been preconfigured as a Kubernetes cluster running the **Cilium** Container Network Interface (CNI). All three VMs connect to the **London** XRd router.


1. **From the topology host terminal** in visual code, SSH to *London-vm-00* 
    ```
    ssh cisco@london-vm-00
    ```
   
2. Optional: check IPv6 connectivity from **london-vm-00** to **london xrd01**

    ![London xrd01](../topo_drawings/lab1-london-xrd01.png)

    ```
    ping fc00:0:800::1 -c 2
    ```

## Validate ISIS Topology

The XRd network is running ISIS with basic settings pre-configured at startup in lab 1.

![ISIS Topology](../topo_drawings/isis-topology-medium.png)

For full size image see [LINK](../topo_drawings/isis-topology-large.png)


1. SSH into any router and verify that ISIS is up and running and all seven nodes are accounted for in the topology database


    ```
    show isis topology
    ```

    You should expect to see an entry for each xrd router 01 (London) -> 07 (Rome)
    ```
      RP/0/RP0/CPU0:london#show isis topology

      rome               3         amsterdam          Gi0/0/0/1       *PtoP*        
      RP/0/RP0/CPU0:london#

    ```

    From London’s perspective, the IS-IS topology shows a Level-2-only network design and reachability achieved through L2 SPF computation. 


2. On **London-xrd01** validate end-to-end ISIS reachability by pinging **Rome-xrd07**:
   ```
   ping 10.0.0.7 source lo0
   ping fc00:0000:7777::1 source lo0
   ```

### Add Synthetic Latency to the Links

> [!NOTE]
> In a default containerlab environment pings would have round-trip times of approximately 1–3 ms. To better approximate real-world WAN conditions we're going to add synthetic latency on the underlying Linux links to match the values shown in the diagram. These latencies are not meant to be realistic measurements, but rather a controlled mechanism to introduce deterministic path variation for later TE and path-selection exercises.
   
![WAN Latencies](../topo_drawings/lab1-latencies.png)


1. From a *topology-host* terminal session run the `add-latency.sh` script:
   ```
   ~/LTRSPG-2212/lab_1/add-latency.sh
   ```
   
## Validate BGP Peering

In the XRd network we are running a single BGP ASN 65000. Routers **xrd05** and **xrd06** are functioning as route reflectors and **xrd01** and **xrd07** are RR clients. 

![BGP Topology](../topo_drawings/bgp-topology-medium.png)

For full size image see [LINK](../topo_drawings/bgp-topology-large.png)

1. SSH into **London-xrd01** using the visual code extension and verify its neighbor state
    ```
    show ip bgp neighbors brief
    ```
    ```
      RP/0/RP0/CPU0:london#show ip bgp neighbors brief 
      Thu Jan  8 05:12:54.585 UTC

      RP/0/RP0/CPU0:london#
    ``` 

2. Verify that router **london-xrd01** is advertising the attached ipv6 network ```fc00:0:1111::1/128``` 
    ```
    show bgp ipv6 unicast advertised summary
    ```

    ```
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:london#show bgp ipv6 unicast advertised summary

    Processed 1 prefixes, 2 paths
    ```

3. Verify that router **London-xrd01** has received route ```fc00:0:7777::1/128``` from the route reflectors **Paris-xrd05** and **Barcelona-xrd06**. Look for ```Paths: (2 available)```. (fc00:0:7777::1/128 is the loopback interface of the **Rome-xrd07 router**)
    ```
    show bgp ipv6 unicast fc00:0:7777::1/128

## Configure and Validate SRv6

With SRv6 uSID:

 - The outer IPv6 destination address becomes the uSID carrier with the first 32-bits representing the uSID block, and the 6 remaining 16-bit chunks of the address become uSIDs or instructions
 - The existing ISIS and BGP Control Plane is leveraged without any change
 - The SRH can be used if our uSID instruction set extends beyond the 6 available in the outer IPv6 destination address
 - SRv6 uSID is based on the Compressed SRv6 Segment List Encoding in [RFC 9080](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9800/)

For reference one of the most recent IOS-XR Configuration guides for SR/SRv6 and ISIS can be found here: [LINK](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/cisco8000/segment-routing/25xx/configuration/guide/b-segment-routing-cg-cisco8000-25xx.html)

> [!NOTE]
> We've preconfigured SRv6 on **xrd02** thru **xrd06**, so you'll only need to configure **xrd01** and **xrd07**

1. SSH to **London-xrd01** and enable SRv6 globally and define SRv6 locator and source address for outbound encapsulation 


    ```
    conf t

    segment-routing
      srv6
        encapsulation
          source-address fc00:0000:1111::1
        locators
          locator MyLocator
            micro-segment behavior unode psp-usd
            prefix fc00:0000:1111::/48
       commit
    ```

2. Enable SRv6 for ISIS  
    ```
    router isis 100
      address-family ipv6 unicast
         segment-routing srv6
           locator MyLocator
       commit
    ```

3. Enable SRv6 for BGP 
    ```
    router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 unicast
      segment-routing srv6
      locator MyLocator
      !
    ! 
    address-family ipv6 unicast
      segment-routing srv6
      locator MyLocator
      !
    !
    commit
    ```

### Configure SRv6 on xrd07


1. Using the Visual Code extension ssh to **Rome-xrd07** and apply the below config in a single shot:

![ssh into xrd07](../topo_drawings/lab1-ssh-xrd07.png)


```
    conf t

    router isis 100
     address-family ipv6 unicast
     segment-routing srv6
     locator MyLocator
     !
    !
    router bgp 65000
     address-family ipv4 unicast
     segment-routing srv6
     locator MyLocator
     !
    ! 
    address-family ipv6 unicast
     segment-routing srv6
     locator MyLocator
     !
    !
    segment-routing
     srv6
     encapsulation
     source-address fc00:0000:7777::1
    !
     locators
      locator MyLocator
       micro-segment behavior unode psp-usd
       prefix fc00:0000:7777::/48
      !
    !
    commit
```

### Validate SRv6 configuration and reachability

1. On **London-xrd01** run validation commands
    ```
    show segment-routing srv6 sid
    ```
    ```diff
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:london#show segment-routing srv6 sid
    Fri Jan  9 04:18:55.955 UTC

    *** Locator: 'MyLocator' ***

    fc00:0:1111:e000::          uA (PSP/USD)      [Gi0/0/0/1, Link-Local]:0:P       isis-100            InUse  Y

    +fc00:0:1111:e004::          uDT4              'default'                         bgp-65000           InUse  Y 
    +fc00:0:1111:e005::          uDT6              'default'                         bgp-65000           InUse  Y 
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The bottom two entries. These SIDs belong to BGP and represent End.DT behaviors. Normally these would be associated with VRFs, but we wanted to show that SRv6 and SRv6-TE capabilities can apply to global table traffic as well. Any packet arriving with either of these SIDs as the outer IPv6 destination address will be decapsulated and then an LPM lookup in the global/default routing table will be performed on the inner destination address. 

2. Validate the SRv6 prefix-SID configuration. As example for **London-xrd01** look for *SID value: fc00:0000:1111::*
    ```
    show isis segment-routing srv6 locator detail 
    ```
    ```diff
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:london#show isis segment-routing srv6 locators detail  
    Fri Jan  9 04:28:37.293 UTC

## Edgeshark introduction


EdgeShark is a browser-based packet capture and analysis tool built into Containerlab. Key features of Edgeshark for our lab.
* Support for Docker containers
* Integrated with Visual Studio Code through Containerlab extensions
* Within Visual Studio Code you can highlight an XRd router link and launch a capture directly

We will use this tool within the labs to allow the students to see actual SRv6 packets on the wire.

To launch EdgeShark and inspect traffic, simply click on the interface you want to capture packets from in the Containerlab tab within Visual Studio Code. In this case, we want to capture traffic on interface Gi0/0/0/1 of *London-xrd01*.

![Edgeshark launch](../topo_drawings/lab1-edgeshark-launch.png)

Clicking on the interface will automatically launch wireshark and starts the capture.

## End of Lab 1

Lab 1 is completed, please proceed to [Lab 2](https://github.com/cisco-asp-web/LTRSPG-2212/blob/main/lab_2/lab_2-guide.md)
