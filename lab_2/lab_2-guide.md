# Lab 2: Configure SRv6 L3VPN and SRv6-TE [20 Min]

> Tip: Attention to detail matters—sometimes the data plane hides more than just packets.

### Description
In Lab 2 we will establish an SRv6 Layer-3 VPN named *`carrots`*.  The *carrots* vrf will include the *London "storage"* and *Rome* containers connected to **london-xrd01** and **rome-xrd07**.  

Once the L3VPN is established we will then setup SRv6-TE traffic steering from *London* such that traffic to *Rome* prefix *`40.0.0.0/24`* will take a different path than traffic to Rome prefix *`50.0.0.0/24`*.

## Configure SRv6 L3VPN
The SRv6-based IPv4/IPv6 L3VPN featureset enables operation of IPv4/IPv6 L3VPN over a SRv6 data plane. Traditionally L3VPN has been operated over MPLS or SR-MPLS. SRv6 L3VPN uses the locator/function aspect of SRv6 Segment IDs (SIDs) instead of PE + VPN labels. 

Example: 

|     Locator    | Function |                                         
|:---------------|:--------:|
| fc00:0000:7777:|   e004:: |


In this lab a BGP L3VPN SID will be allocated in per-VRF mode and provides End.DT4 or End.DT6 functionality. End.DT4/6 represents the Endpoint with decapsulation and IPv4 or v6 lookup in a specific VRF table.

For more details on SRv6 network programming Endpoint Behavior functionality please see RFC 8986 [LINK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8986#name-enddt6-decapsulation-and-sp)

BGP encodes the SRv6 SID in the prefix-SID attribute of the IPv4/6 L3VPN Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and advertises it via it's MP-BGP peers. The Ingress PE (provider edge) router encapsulates the VRF IPv4/6 traffic with the SRv6 VPN SID and sends it over the SRv6 network.

The *carrots* VRFs is setup on the two edge routers in our SP network: **london-xrd01** and **rome-xrd07**. Intermediate routers do not need to be VRF aware and are instead forwarding on the SRv6 data plane. *(technically the intermediate routers don't need to be SRv6 aware and could simply perform IPv6 forwarding based on the outer IPv6 header)*.  

The VRF instances and their interfaces have been preconfigured, allowing us to focus on the SRv6 BGP configuration. 

Optional: if you wish to see the existing VRF configuration run these commands on *rome-xrd07*:
```
show run vrf
show run interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0/0
```

### Configure SRv6 L3VPN on rome-xrd07

We'll start with **rome-xrd07** as it will need a pair of static routes for reachability to the  **Rome container's** "40" and "50" network prefixes (loopback interfaces). Later we'll create SRv6-TE steering policies for traffic to the "40" and "50" prefixes:  

> [!NOTE]
> All of the below commands are also available in the *`quick config doc.`*. Be aware that the quick config document contains both the L3VPN configuration as well as the L3VPN TE configuration. [HERE](https://github.com/cisco-asp-web/LTRSPG-2212/blob/main/lab_2/lab_2_quick_config.md) 

   
1. **rome-xrd07** vrf static route configuration
   
   SSH into rome-xrd07 and copy/paste the static route config below the image:

   **rome-xrd07**
   ```yaml
      conf t
      
      router static
        vrf carrots
          address-family ipv4 unicast
            40.0.0.0/24 10.107.1.2
            50.0.0.0/24 10.107.1.2
          commit
    ```
2. Verify **Rome** VRF prefix reachability  
    Ping check from Rome-xrd07 gi 0/0/0/0 to Rome's Container NIC:  
    ```
    ping vrf carrots 10.107.1.1
    ping vrf carrots 40.0.0.1
    ping vrf carrots 50.0.0.1
    ping vrf carrots fc00:0:107:1::2
    ```

3. Enable BGP L3VPN on **rome-xrd07**
   
     The *carrots* L3VPN is dual-stack so we will be adding both vpnv4 and vpnv6 address-families to the BGP neighbor-group for ipv6 peers. For example you will enable L3VPN in the neighbor-group template by issuing the *address-family vpnv4/6 unicast* command. 

    **Rome-xrd07**
    ```yaml
    conf t
    router bgp 65000
      neighbor-group xrd-ipv6-peer
        address-family vpnv4 unicast
        next-hop-self

        address-family vpnv6 unicast
        next-hop-self
      commit
    ```

4. Enable SRv6 for VRF carrots and redistribute connected/static
   
    Next we add VRF *carrots* into BGP and enable SRv6 to the IPv4 and IPv6 address family with the command *`segment-routing srv6`*. In addition we will tie the VRF to the SRv6 locator *`MyLocator`* configured in Lab 1.

    On **rome-xrd07** we will need to redistribute both the connected and static routes to provide reachability to Rome and its additional prefixes. Therefore, we will add *`redistribute static`* for VRF *carrots*.

    **rome-xrd07**  
    ```yaml
    conf t
    router bgp 65000
      vrf carrots
        rd auto
        address-family ipv4 unicast
          segment-routing srv6
          locator MyLocator
          alloc mode per-vrf
          redistribute static
          redistribute connected
      
        address-family ipv6 unicast
          segment-routing srv6
          locator MyLocator
          alloc mode per-vrf
          redistribute static
          redistribute connected
      commit
      ```
### Configure SRv6 L3VPN on xrd01 and RR xrd05

1. Using the visual code extension, ssh to **london-xrd01** and apply the configuration in a single step:

    ```yaml
    conf t

    router bgp 65000
    neighbor-group xrd-ipv6-peer
      address-family vpnv4 unicast
      next-hop-self
      
      address-family vpnv6 unicast
      next-hop-self
      
    vrf carrots
      rd auto
      address-family ipv4 unicast
      segment-routing srv6
        locator MyLocator
        alloc mode per-vrf
      redistribute connected
      
      address-family ipv6 unicast
      segment-routing srv6
        locator MyLocator
        alloc mode per-vrf
      redistribute connected
    commit
    ```

#### Route Reflectors Configuration 
   
The BGP route reflectors **paris-xrd05** and **barcelona-xrd06** also need L3VPN configuration added to their peering group. In order to save some time we've preconfigured both with this:

```yaml
    conf t
    
    router bgp 65000
    neighbor-group xrd-ipv6-peer
      address-family vpnv4 unicast
      route-reflector-client
      
      address-family vpnv6 unicast
      route-reflector-client
    commit
```


### Validate SRv6 L3VPN

Validation command output examples can be found at this [LINK](/lab_2/validation-cmd-output.md)
> [!NOTE]
> It can take a few seconds after configuration before you see routes populate through the network and be visible in the routing tables.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> From **london-xrd01** run the following set of validation commands (for the sake of time you can paste them in as a group, or spot check some subset of commands). 

   ```
   show segment-routing srv6 sid
   show bgp vpnv4 unicast
   show bgp vrf carrots 40.0.0.0/24
   show bgp vpnv6 unicast
   ping vrf carrots 40.0.0.1
   ping vrf carrots 50.0.0.1
   ```

## Configure SRv6-TE steering for L3VPN
**Rome's** L3VPN IPv4 prefixes are associated with two classes of traffic:

* The **"40"** destination (40.0.0.0/24) is bulk transport destination (content replication or data backups) and thus latency and loss tolerant. 
  
* The **"50"** destination (50.0.0.0/24) is for real time traffic (live video, etc.) and thus require the lowest latency path available.

We will use the below diagram for reference:

<img src="../topo_drawings/lab2-l3vpn-policy.png" width="800" />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A subsequent section of this lab will validate end-to-end connectivity between the London and Rome containers, providing a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough of traffic forwarding across the network from ingress to egress.

### Create SRv6-TE steering policy
For our SRv6-TE purposes we'll leverage the on-demand nexthop (ODN) feature set. Here is a nice example and explanation of ODN: [HERE](https://xrdocs.io/design/blogs/latest-converged-sdn-transport-ig)

In our lab we will configure **rome-xrd07** as the egress PE router with the ODN method. This will trigger **rome-xrd07** to advertise its L3VPN routes with *`color extended communities`*. We'll do this by first defining the *`extcomms`*, then setting up route-policies to match on destination prefixes and set the *`extcomm`* values.

The ingress PE, **london-xrd01**, will then be configured with SRv6 segment-lists and SRv6 ODN steering policies that match routes with the respective color and apply the appropriate SID stack on outbound traffic.

1. Prior to configuring SRv6-TE policy lets get a baseline look at our vpvn4 route as viewed from **london-xrd01**
   Run the following command:
   ```
   show bgp vpnv4 uni vrf carrots 40.0.0.0/24
   ```

   ```diff
   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:london#show bgp vpnv4 uni vrf carrots 40.0.0.0/24
   <snip> 
     Local
       fc00:0:7777::1 (metric 3) from fc00:0:5555::1 (10.0.0.7)
        Received Label 0xe0060
         Origin incomplete, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal, best, group-best, import-candidate, imported
         Received Path ID 0, Local Path ID 1, version 63
   +     Extended community: RT:9:9 <- NO COLOR OPTION APPLIED
         Originator: 10.0.0.7, Cluster list: 10.0.0.5
         PSID-Type:L3, SubTLV Count:1
          SubTLV:
          T:1(Sid information), Sid:fc00:0:7777::(Transposed), Behavior:63, SS-TLV Count:1
               SubSubTLV:
             T:1(Sid structure):
         Source AFI: VPNv4 Unicast, Source VRF: default, Source Route Distinguisher: 10.0.0.7:1
   ```
      
2. On **rome-xrd07** configure ext-comms, route-policies, and BGP such that *rome-xrd07* advertises Rome's "40" and "50" prefixes with their respective color extended communities:

   Using the visual code extension, SSH into *rome-xrd07* and paste the following commands:

   ```yaml
   conf t
   extcommunity-set opaque bulk-transfer
     40
   end-set
 
   extcommunity-set opaque low-latency
     50
   end-set

   route-policy set-color
     if destination in (40.0.0.0/24) then
       set extcommunity color bulk-transfer
     endif
     if destination in (50.0.0.0/24) then
       set extcommunity color low-latency
     endif
     pass
   end-policy

   router bgp 65000
   neighbor-group xrd-ipv6-peer
     address-family vpnv4 unicast
     route-policy set-color out
    
     address-family vpnv6 unicast
     route-policy set-color out
   commit
   ```

3. Validate vpnv4 prefixes are received at **london-xrd01** and that they have their color extcomms:
   

   Using the visual code extension, SSH into xrd01 and paste the following commands:


   ```
   show bgp vpnv4 uni vrf carrots 40.0.0.0/24 
   show bgp vpnv4 uni vrf carrots 50.0.0.0/24
   ```
   
   Example:
   ```diff
   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:london#show bgp vpnv4 uni vrf carrots 40.0.0.0/24
    <snip>
     Local
       fc00:0:7777::1 (metric 3) from fc00:0:5555::1 (10.0.0.7)
         Received Label 0xe0060
         Origin incomplete, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal, best, group-best, import-candidate, imported
         Received Path ID 0, Local Path ID 1, version 67
   +     Extended community: Color:40 RT:9:9  <- COLOR 40 APPLIED
         Originator: 10.0.0.7, Cluster list: 10.0.0.5
         PSID-Type:L3, SubTLV Count:1
          SubTLV:
           T:1(Sid information), Sid:fc00:0:7777::(Transposed), Behavior:63, SS-TLV Count:1
            SubSubTLV:
             T:1(Sid structure):
         Source AFI: VPNv4 Unicast, Source VRF: default, Source Route Distinguisher: 10.0.0.7:1
   ```

4. On **london-xrd01** configure a pair of SRv6-TE segment lists for steering traffic over these specific paths through the network: 
    - Segment list *xrd2347* will execute the explicit path: xrd01 -> 02 -> 03 -> 04 -> 07
    - Segment list *xrd567* will execute the explicit path: xrd01 -> 05 -> 06 -> 07

   **london-xrd01**
   ```yaml
   conf t
   segment-routing
    traffic-eng
     segment-lists
      srv6
       sid-format usid-f3216
      
      segment-list xrd2347
       srv6
        index 10 sid fc00:0:2222::
        index 20 sid fc00:0:3333::
        index 30 sid fc00:0:4444::

      segment-list xrd567
       srv6
        index 10 sid fc00:0:5555::
        index 20 sid fc00:0:6666::
     commit
   ```

5. On **london-xrd01** configure our bulk transport and low latency SRv6 steering policies. Low latency traffic will be forced over the *xrd01-05-06-07* path, and bulk transport traffic will take the longer *xrd01-02-03-04-07* path:
  
   **london-xrd01**
   ```yaml
   conf t
   segment-routing
   traffic-eng

     policy bulk-transfer
     srv6
       locator MyLocator binding-sid dynamic behavior ub6-insert-reduced
     
     color 40 end-point ipv6 fc00:0:7777::1
     candidate-paths
       preference 100
       explicit segment-list xrd2347
      
     policy low-latency
     srv6
       locator MyLocator binding-sid dynamic behavior ub6-insert-reduced
    
     color 50 end-point ipv6 fc00:0:7777::1
     candidate-paths
       preference 100
       explicit segment-list xrd567
     commit
   ```

6. Validate **london-xrd01's** SRv6-TE SID policy is enabled and up:
   ```
    show segment-routing srv6 sid
   ```
   
   Example output, note the additional uDT VRF carrots and SRv6-TE **uB6 Insert.Red** SIDs added to the list:
