# Welcome to SRv6 Innovations: Modern AI networks: IOS-XR, SRv6, Cilium, and SONiC


## Introduction: 

In this immersive hands-on lab we will explore how to build SRv6 WAN networks utilizing L3VPNs, next-generation AI fabric load balancing using SRv6, and Kubernetes-native SRv6 with Cilium. This session walks participants through a series of progressive tutorials and labs covering:

 - SRv6 fundamentals and foundational building blocks for SRv6 L3VPN and Traffic Engineering 

 - Kubernetes integration using Cilium and SRv6 for modern service-aware routing 
  
 - SONiC-based data center fabric bring-up and host-based SRv6 
  
 - Programmatic traffic control using custom SRv6 mappings and intelligent automation 
  
Participants will gain practical skills in deploying flexible, scalable, and programmable infrastructure purpose-built for Service Provider, AI, HPC, or cloud-native workloads.

# dCloud Instances 

All lab instances are running on Cisco dCloud.
The proctors will walk through the complete login and access process during the session, including how to connect to your assigned lab instance.
No preparation or prior access is required before the demonstration.


# dCloud lab Topology

The following diagram shows the dCloud VM topology that will be used for this lab:

## Connecting to your lab

Once you've connected to VPN using the lab assistant, all nodes in the lab can be accessed using a Remote Desktop connection to the windows management host at 198.18.128.102 (admin / cisco123). Here is how to launch a remote desktop connection from your windows computer:

By now, you should be connected to your main Windows workplace for this lab:

![windows-rdpy](./topo_drawings/windows-rdp.png)

On the Windows virtual machine, please launch firefox you shoud arrive on the github page automatically. Please proceed to [LAB 1](https://github.com/cisco-asp-web/LTRSPG-2212/blob/main/lab_1/lab_1-guide.md)
